CMS App Deployment Analysis: VM vs App Service
1. Cost Analysis

Azure Virtual Machine (VM):

Compute cost billed per VM size (CPU, RAM) and uptime.

Storage billed separately for OS disk and data disks.

Requires manual maintenance and monitoring, which increases operational cost.

Example: Standard D2s v3 VM (~2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM) ~ $75/month.

Total cost can be higher due to management overhead.

Azure App Service:

Billed per App Service Plan (tier: Basic, Standard, Premium).

Infrastructure management included; less operational effort.

Storage mostly included; additional storage billed separately.

Example: Standard S1 App Service Plan ~ $70/month.

Total cost is predictable and generally lower for small-to-medium apps.

2. Scalability Analysis

Azure Virtual Machine (VM):

Manual scaling required (upgrade VM or add more VMs behind load balancer).

Autoscaling possible with VM Scale Sets but requires configuration.

Azure App Service:

Built-in autoscaling based on CPU, memory, or request load.

Scale up (larger instance) or scale out (more instances) via Azure portal easily.

3. Availability Analysis

Azure Virtual Machine (VM):

Single VM failure can impact availability.

Requires multiple VMs in availability sets or zones for high availability.

Backup and patch management handled manually.

Azure App Service:

High availability built-in (SLA 99.95% for Standard/Premium tiers).

Automatic backups, load balancing, and failover handled by Azure.

4. Workflow Analysis

Azure Virtual Machine (VM):

Full control over OS, libraries, and network.

Must manually install Python, Flask, database drivers, and configure security.

Azure App Service:

Simple deployment via GitHub, ZIP, or Azure DevOps.

Infrastructure managed by Azure.

Faster development and deployment cycles.

5. Recommendation

Recommended Solution: Azure App Service

Justification:

Provides built-in scalability and high availability without manual setup.

Deployment is fast and simple, with automatic handling of OS, network, and load balancing.

Cost-effective and predictable, suitable for the CMS app.
